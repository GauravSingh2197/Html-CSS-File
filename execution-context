1. Global Execution Context:

The global execution context is created when the script starts executing.
It represents the default environment where code runs in a global scope.
There is only one global execution context in a JavaScript program.
It includes global variables and functions that are accessible throughout the program.

2.Function Execution Context:

A function execution context is created whenever a function is invoked.
It represents the environment in which the function code is executed.
Each function has its own execution context, which is created and destroyed whenever the function is called and completes its execution.
It includes local variables, function arguments, and the function's scope chain.

3. Eval Execution Context:

The eval function in JavaScript can be used to execute code dynamically.
When code is evaluated using eval, a new execution context called the eval execution context is created.
